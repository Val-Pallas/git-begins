git push: This command is used to push changes from the current branch of your local repository to the corresponding 
branch of the remote repository. For example, if you are on the main branch of your local repository and want to push 
changes to the main branch of the remote repository, you would use the command git push.

git push --all: This command is used to push all branches from your local repository to the remote repository. 
For example, if you have multiple branches in your local repository and want to push all of them to the remote repository,
 you would use the command git push --all.

git push --force: This command is used to force push changes from your local repository to the remote repository, 
overwriting any changes that may be present in the remote repository. This command should be used with caution, 
as it can potentially cause data loss or conflicts with other contributors. Only use this command if you are certain 
that it is safe to do so.
